<!-- The number of cards in overview depends on the no. of cards in json file.
Imagine we have 10 products in the json.
Then we need 10 of these cards.
But imagine that we only have one or two.
Well then, we do not want all the 10 cards but only two.

We do that by creating a template with just one card here and then including one of the templates we have in template-product for each of the cards we want. -->
